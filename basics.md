## ‚òÅ Cloud Foundations - Basics

## Introduction to Cloud

1. First of all, there is nothing like a "Cloud" that powers the Internet. It is somebody else's computer in a Datacenter.

## Definition

Cloud computing refers to the delivery of on-demand computing resources, such as servers, storage, applications, and services, over the internet. Basically, the servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. These servers are located all over the world. 

In Cloud computing, massive scalable IT-related capabilities are provided as a "service" using the internet to multiple customers.

## What is Infrastructure? üè≠
Infrastructure means the physical and virtual components that support an organization's IT systems and processes. It includes the hardware, software, networks, and facilities necessary for an organization to operate and communicate.

Examples of physical infrastructure include Hardware, Networks, and Data servers.

**Software infrastructure** includes operating systems, middleware, databases, and applications.

**Virtual infrastructure** refers to the use of virtualization technologies such as VMWare or Virtual box etc. to create multiple virtual instances of operating systems or applications on a single physical machine. This can help organizations optimize their hardware utilization, improve their application deployment speed, and simplify their IT management.
